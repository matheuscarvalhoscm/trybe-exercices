Hello World! 

This is my first repository (actually the second one, because I've already done a previous repository to test my Git skills, but lst consider that it never existed haha) and I am going to submmit all the exercices I'm doing at Trybe right here.

I've already learned about Unix, Bash & Shell, and I'm currently learning how to use Git and Github.
